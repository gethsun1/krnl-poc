Welcome to the KRNL Proof of Concept (PoC) DApp repository! This project demonstrates the KRNL protocol's functionality and showcases the processes behind customizing and interacting with KRNL tokens, including setting up the **Custom Opinion Maker**, managing the **Custom Token Authority**, and upgrading **KrnlTestToken** for registration to **Kenrnels** within the KRNL ecosystem.

This readme will guide you through the key processes for setting up and using the KRNL DApp.

## Project Overview

The KRNL DApp is designed to work with the **KRNL Protocol**, which allows users to interact with **Kenrnels**, a decentralized platform for registering custom tokens. This PoC demonstrates the core functionality, including token management, adding tokens to whitelists, claiming tokens, and initiating distribution.

The key components in the project are:
- **Custom Opinion Maker**: A decentralized mechanism that allows users to express opinions and vote on token-related decisions.
- **Custom Token Authority**: The entity responsible for minting, transferring, and managing tokens within the KRNL ecosystem.
- **KrnlTestToken**: The token used for testing purposes, which can be upgraded to be registered with Kenrnels.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed:

1. **Node.js** (v14.x or higher)
2. **npm** or **yarn** for package management
3. **MetaMask** or another Web3 wallet for interacting with the DApp
4. **Ethers.js** or **Web3Modal** for Ethereum interaction
5. **Solidity** development environment (e.g., **Truffle**, **Hardhat**, **Remix**)


### Clone the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/gethsun1/krnl-poc.git
cd krnl-poc


### KRNL PoC DApp Setup

## Setting Up the Development Environment

### Install Dependencies:

The project uses React for the frontend and ethers.js for interacting with Ethereum-based smart contracts.  
Run the following command to install dependencies:

```
npm install

## Set Up Web3Modal:
This DApp integrates Web3Modal for connecting wallets to the application. Itâ€™s important that MetaMask or any Web3-compatible wallet is installed and configured in your browser.

### Compile the Smart Contracts:
If you're deploying or testing your own version of the contract, make sure the smart contracts are compiled and migrated correctly using Hardhat or Truffle.

## Custom Opinion Maker Setup
The Custom Opinion Maker is the foundation of decision-making within the KRNL DApp, enabling the community or users to propose opinions that can influence the ecosystem.

### Deploy the Custom Opinion Maker Contract
In your development environment, navigate to the CustomOpinionMaker.sol contract file and deploy it to your chosen test network.
